# aws-extra

Extra layers of usefulness on top of the AWS JavaScript SDK. `aws-extra` is just a wrapper around the individual layers:
* [aws-extra-one](https://gitlab.com/shaungreen/aws-extra-one/wikis/aws-extra-one)

## Layer one
* promisfied aws-sdk (all of it)
* automatic, configurable logging of sdk calls
* automatic pagination of paged sdk calls like `lambda.listFunctions`
